What i'm noticing:

In person game - two kids debate. Kinda like Heads Up
Possibly, could build an online varient with crowd and stuff like Omegle

Feedback:

I think this idea is great! I think it might be cool to not have the outcome shown to the audience before the speaker starts. Then, the speaker gives their speech and then the goal is to get the audience to say yes or no, based on what you were assigned.

I think a reward system for this would be great, like a leaderboard for the most persuasive people or the hottest topics, where people are split.
